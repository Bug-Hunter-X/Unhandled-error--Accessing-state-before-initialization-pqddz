This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  In functional components, this often happens when you try to access state within the component's body before the useState hook has fully run and set the initial state value. 

```javascript
// Incorrect
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(); // State not initialized initially
  console.log(count); // Trying to access count before initialization
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

This might not immediately throw an error, but the value of `count` will be `undefined`, resulting in unexpected behavior (like an empty Text component or a JavaScript error if other operations depend on a numeric `count`).
